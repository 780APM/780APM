  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Experince </h3></summary>
    Starting in 2019 with my computer science degree, I had 0 coding experience after deciding that medicine wasn't for me. I progressed through my first two years with flying colors until finding a real passion and interest in AI during my final year, writing my dissertation on a custom ML model. This model used a weighted bias model focusing on weighted node inputs from a trained data set, the goal of this was to accurately predict the accuracy of hand written numerical digits from the nMist data set with tools such as NumPy, Keras & MatPlotLib, and then applying data visualization to gauge and represent the accuracy of the models, using techniques such as confusion matrices and linear regression charts. Now I am currently working as a full stack developer for Dutch Digital Systems, taking on the role in conjunction with implementation consulting for clients, bridging the gap between meeting their needs and developing their ideas. Working with a unique high level programming codebase that manages front-end, back-end and web development elements.
