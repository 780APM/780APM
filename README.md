  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey </h3></summary>
    In 2019, I embarked on my computer science journey with no prior coding experience, having shifted my focus from medicine. The first couple of years were a real challenge, but with dedication and hard work, I pushed through. It wasn't until my final year that I discovered my true passion for AI and based my dissertation on crafting a custom ML model. This model employed a weighted bias system, concentrating on inputs from a trained dataset, with the aim of accurately predicting handwritten numerical digits from the nMist dataset. I used tools like NumPy, Keras, and MatPlotLib, and spiced things up with data visualization techniques such as confusion matrices and linear regression charts. Since then, I've taken on various developer roles for different companies, where I've not only honed my skills but also worked closely with clients to bring their ideas to life. These positions have required me to handle high-level programming for front-end, back-end, and web development, providing a diverse and dynamic range of experiences.
